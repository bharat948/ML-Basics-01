 01-# Credit Card Fraud Detection

   This project implements various machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud using the "credit_card_fraud" dataset from Hugging Face.

   ## Setup

   1. Create a virtual environment:
      ```
      python -m venv myenv
      ```

   2. Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
      - On macOS and Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`

   3. Install required packages:
      ```
      pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy imbalanced-learn datasets
      ```

   ## Running the models

   To run each model, use the following commands:

   - Logistic Regression: `python logistic_regression.py`
   - K-Nearest Neighbors: `python k_nearest_neighbors.py`
   - Decision Tree: `python decision_tree.py`
   - Random Forest: `python random_forest.py`
   - Support Vector Machine: `python support_vector_machine.py`
   - Naive Bayes: `python naive_bayes.py`

   Each script will output the model's accuracy, AUC-ROC score, and a classification report.
